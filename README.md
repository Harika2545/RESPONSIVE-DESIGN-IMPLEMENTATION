### **Task 2: Responsive Design Implementation**

The objective of this task is to design and develop a **responsive webpage** that adjusts seamlessly to different screen sizes and devices, ensuring a consistent and visually appealing user experience. With the growing diversity of devices such as smartphones, tablets, laptops, and desktops, it has become essential for web developers to create designs that automatically adapt to varying screen resolutions and orientations. This task aims to demonstrate the understanding and application of **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** in implementing a fully responsive layout that maintains usability and aesthetics across all platforms.

To accomplish this, **HTML (HyperText Markup Language)** is used as the structural foundation of the webpage. It defines the core elements such as headers, sections, navigation bars, and content containers. The HTML file organizes the page into logical sections including a navigation bar, hero section, about section, projects section, contact form, and footer. Each section is designed with semantic tags to ensure better readability and accessibility. Proper use of semantic HTML also improves search engine optimization (SEO) and makes the website more maintainable.

**CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)** plays a crucial role in this task by defining the presentation and layout of the webpage. The styling ensures a clean and modern appearance with a balanced color palette, consistent typography, and suitable spacing. The main highlight of this task is the implementation of **responsive design techniques** using **CSS media queries** and **flexible grid layouts**. Media queries allow the webpage to detect the screen width and adjust its layout accordingly. For instance, when the screen width is reduced below 900 pixels, the project section changes from a three-column grid to two columns. Similarly, on screens smaller than 600 pixels, the layout switches to a single-column view, and the navigation menu collapses into a hamburger icon for easier access on mobile devices.

Additionally, **JavaScript** is integrated to enhance interactivity and responsiveness. A simple JavaScript script enables the hamburger menu functionality, allowing users to toggle the navigation menu on smaller screens. This improves usability by ensuring that the navigation remains accessible without cluttering the interface. The use of JavaScript demonstrates how dynamic behavior can be combined with static design principles to create engaging web experiences.

The final deliverable of this task is a **fully responsive webpage** that maintains its structure, readability, and functionality across different screen sizes. The webpage successfully demonstrates the ability to create adaptive designs that provide a consistent user experience on all devices. It also highlights the importance of planning layout structures, understanding viewport settings, and applying responsive units like percentages and flexible grids.

In summary, this task emphasizes the core principles of modern web design â€” flexibility, accessibility, and user experience. By using HTML for structure, CSS for styling and responsiveness, and JavaScript for interactivity, the webpage serves as a practical example of responsive web development. The project showcases the application of theoretical concepts in a real-world scenario, reflecting both creativity and technical proficiency in front-end design.
